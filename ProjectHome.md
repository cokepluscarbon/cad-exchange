Software tools for converting CAD part file data.  For instance, 'pro2sw' is a software tool that converts simple 2D sections from Pro/Engineer's native file format to SolidWorks' format. This tool is meant to demonstrate the usefulness and success of the formal language approach to CAD interoperability presented in previous work <a href='http://people.cs.umass.edu/~jaltidor/idetc2011.pdf'>(pdf)</a>. It is important to note that this software tool is intended for use converting simple 2D sections and not complete 3D part files. These 2D sections can only contain straight lines or boxes created using the line or rectangle tool. These lines do not need to be horizontal or vertical. Line and line to point dimensions can also be used. Simple constraints like "same point", "point on entity", "horizontal" and "vertical" are covered by the conversion rules.
